                    As we got further and further away, it [the Earth]
                    diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
                    marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful,
                    warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if
                    you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing
                    this has to change a man.

                <p>
                    Never in all their history have men been able truly to
                    conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe,
                    having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all
                    the directions eventually meet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Which there is no center because every point, or none, is
                    center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The
                    airman's earth, if free men make it.

                        The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly
                        alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic.
                        The Earth was absolutely round.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue,
                        was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and
                        my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.

        What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

        Adaptive websites have hard coded layout widths at each media query while fully responsive website uses fully responsive units at all levels of the website.

        Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

        Mobile first is starting at a mobile view and working up to desktop. You would use min-width at your breakpoints. Desktop first is going from desktop and moving down to mobile. You would use max-width at breakpoints.
        
        What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

        It makes it so 1rem = 10px. That way its easier to use rems but also gives the user adaptiveness if their default html in the browser is larger.
        
        How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

        I would say its like a dlc to a video game where you get extra content and features. It uses node as the compiler and lets you use functions, mixin, variables etc in css. Its kind of like having a programming language in your css.
        
        What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

        I like that we can import multi less files to the index less file. It helps keep code organized. I also like having variables to help with styling. Not a big fan of mixins yet but i might just need to see other scenerios where i can use them. -->
